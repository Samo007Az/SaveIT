SaveIT is an app where you can input code, your shopping list, or other important notes to remember, then easily save them. While other note apps offer similar features, SaveIT plans to provide regular updates with additional functionalities. The app has been tested on iOS 15-16.6.1 A12; compatibility with lower versions may be affected due to the deprecation of the â€˜windowsâ€™ feature in iOS 15.0. SaveIT was developed with Swifty, and special thanks to @SparkleChanJB (Twitter) for making it possible! ðŸ’— If users find value in SaveIT, future updates will depend on their feedback and support.
